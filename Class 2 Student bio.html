		<p>
		I was born in Modesto, CA but I grew up in Casper, WY. I graduated from Kelly Walsh High School in 2008. I started at Colorado State University in 2008 studying Biology. After 3 semesters, I changed my major to Geology, received my B.S. in Geology from the University of Wyoming, and went on to get my masters in 2014 from Colorado School of Mines. I have been working as a geologist at Encana since the summer of 2014.

		In my free time, I enjoy hanging with my kitties, playing video games, catching up on shows, martial arts, and spending time with my boyfriend... I guess.
